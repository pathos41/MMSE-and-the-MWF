# MMSE-and-the-MWF
The MMSE-based Mercury/Waterfilling (MWF) 

mmse_fig_3_extend_to_100.m shows the MMSE (in logarithmic scale) versus SNR[dB] for BPSK, QPSK, 4-PAM, 16-QAM and Gaussian inputs.

mmse_fig_4.m gives MMSE of QPSK and its High Power Expansion.

mmse_fig_5.m, mmse_fig_6.m, mmse_fig_7.m and mmse_fig_7_inset.m gives graphic interpretations for the derivation of the optimal power allocation under different scenarios.
